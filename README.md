# M8NI
Script-Parser for low-level, bit-limited programming.

---
# Usage
Start the app using `start.bat` or a shell file of your choice.
Do not start the `.jar` file directly (It won't do anything).
Memory pre-definitions cannot be created, so you'll have to use `INC` and `DEC` before executing your initial script.

### Main Window Usage
Syntax:  ```M8NI/><FILE LOCATION> <BIT SIZE>```

Example: ```M8NI/>./my-script.m8 8```

# Installation
Simply go to [Releases](https://github.com/ah1m1/M8NI/releases) and download the newest build.
